This is an example asset file.

Assets are files NOT intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

Examples of asset files:
- Templates (HTML, PowerPoint, etc.)
- Images (logos, icons)
- Boilerplate code
- Fonts
- Sample documents that get copied or modified

This file should be customized or deleted based on your skill's needs.

For example, if you're building a frontend-webapp-builder skill, you might have:
- assets/frontend-template/index.html
- assets/frontend-template/style.css
- assets/frontend-template/app.js

If you're building a brand-guidelines skill, you might have:
- assets/logo.png
- assets/font.ttf
- assets/presentation-template.pptx
